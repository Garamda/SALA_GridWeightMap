# SALA_GridWeightMap
SALA is the algorithm for precise detecting the location of indoor IoT devices. Among key parts of SALA, I implemented the grid weight map construction part.

Since it was private group project, hereby I only upload my part.
The code in my part returns the estimated location of the indoor IoT device.
